# Platformer-Game
First time using OOP concepts in Python to produce a platformer game using the Pygame Library.  

Requirements: Pygame

Controls: WASD to move, left click to shoot, ESC to access menu. 

Aim: Proceed through 3 increasingly challenging levels to complete the game. Enemies can be killed by shooting them or jumping on them. There is a boss in the final level. 

# Level-Creator
Tool that enables level design for the game.

Controls: WASD to move, left click to place block, right click to change block type. 

Once the level has been designed, the coordinates for the new level are displayed in the shell. These can be copied into the game code to implement the new design. However, this programme could easily be redesigned to export the new level into a txt file and then read into the game.
